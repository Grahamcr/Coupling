Coupling
========

This is a web site that will automatically assign pairs for any given iteration.


Intended to make it quick and easy to pair off, and encourage people to pair with people who they haven't paired with in a while.

Have fun!


To install and run, you'll need to have mongo and node installed. Once you've got that...

1. Clone the Coupling repository.
2. In the Coupling directory, run the command "node app.js"
3. Now you can browse to the Coupling website in a browser at http://localhost:3000 to confirm it works.
4. If you get an error message telling you that mongo isn't working... start mongo. Then check the website again.
5. Try it out and let me know what you think!


What is Pairing?
----------------
  Pairing is the act of two specialists in one profession working together on the same task concurrently. This allows for constant collaboration when brainstorming for solutions, reinforcement of standards and cultural norms, and immediate peer-review of all work being produced. This helps build trust that all the content created by the pair is valuable and safe.

Why Should Pairs Be Rotated?
----------------------------
  For better or for worse, teams are made up of people, and people have different skill levels, opinions, temperments and philosophies. Rotating pairs is intended to help make sure that senior people will get to synchronize with other senior people periodically. Similarly, junior team members should get the opportunity to work with other junior team members - this gives them the opportunity to test their growth. Regular rotation of pairs also helps discourage project knowledge from being reserved for a few 'smart' individuals... at the very least, many other team members should see and participate in decisions regularly.

How Does Coupling Choose Pairs?
-------------------------------

Coupling remembers the history of every pair its ever made. The longer you use it, the more it knows! This is important, because Coupling follows these rules:

1. Whoever has not paired together for the longest time will be automatically paired together.
2. When there are multiple potential pairs that have been apart for the longest time, one is chosen at random. Rules continue as normal with the remaining players.

Those rules are repeated until there are no players remaining to be paired together. This encourages teams to let everybody work together, and that helps build relationships among team members. The best way to learn how to work together is to actually, directly work together.
